# TI Car Cup
IDE Car code repo

## About
Come see live racing of autonomous 1/18-scale cars created by RIT Computer Engineering student teams. For this competition student teams build, program, and race a model car around a track for speed. The winning car is the fastest to complete the track without derailing. To produce these cars on a standard chassis, students blend electrical engineering, computer engineering, and mechanical engineering skills on circuits, electronics, control theories, interfacing, and embedded systems through team work. The teams will be racing during Imagine RIT.
